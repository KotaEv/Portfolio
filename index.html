              I have been a musician for as long as I can                                            remember.</p>
          <p class="p-about">After college, I was a worship pastor for a while and                                 then have been searching for my true calling ever since.
            </p>
            <p class="p-about">
              When I started looking into career paths, I knew               something with technology was the right choice for me. </p>
          <p class="p-about">I have a logical brain and love to work                on puzzles as well as design. </p>
          <p class="p-about">As a student at Thinkful I am able to hone my skills as a developer.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4-center">
              If you are looking for a developer (or want to                  work on some cool hackathons!) feel free to                    reach out anytime!
